# Imputation of cancer proteomics data with a deep model that learns from many datasets
Code used to generate figures in our [manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.26.609780v2) focusing on data imputation for mass spectrometry proteomics. If you're interested in the software tool used to impute missing values in this manuscript, you can find the Lupine package [here](https://github.com/Noble-Lab/lupine).
